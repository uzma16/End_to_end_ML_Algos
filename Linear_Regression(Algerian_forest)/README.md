# WildFire Prediction

In our project, wildfire prediction is achieved through machine learning model. By considering factors like weather conditions, vegetation health, and historical fire patterns, our predictive models enable early detection, empowering proactive measures to mitigate the impact of wildfires.

## Algorithm

Linear Regression is used in order to predict the FWI.

## Frontend

Here, I've used streamlit library in order to interact with the algorithm.

## How to Run?

- Clone the repository
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- streamlit run application.py
